I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

I think the total weight of items served must have been about 8 ounces.  The carpaccio only covered a quarter of the plate, the \\\"scallops\\\" consisted of a single scallop each!!  The pear for desert was about the size of a small tangerine.  I've never seen a ripe pear that small! They brought out covered plates in order for us not to be shocked until they removed the cover.  Should have asked for a magnifying glass to find the food on the plate.  It was like the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - it was hilarious.  If it wasn't for the bread and butter we would have starved.  Of course drinks are not included.  To add insult to injury you get an additional $35 bill tacked on for service, tip, and tax.  Would have preferred a gourmet meal at MacDonalds.  I almost forgot to mention this place has all the ambiance of a restroom.  No windows - small interior rooms.  There was a private party in the main dining area so they put us in an elevator and put us in what I call the \\\"annex\\\" upstairs with even less ambiance - looked like a converted hallway!
